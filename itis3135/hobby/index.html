                    My name is Elif and I am a self claimed cooking enthusisast. I believe I do it as a hobby and I created this page to talk more about my hobby and other aspects of it. Some would think I did it to complete my Midterm project for the class ITSC 3130 which also happens to be 15% of my grade, however I am just very passionate about website and my hobby. You might think <em>'this is completely useless'</em> and you might be right but I am learning how to make a freaking website and that all that is. Nothing is really that deep, neither is this paragraph, but that is not the point go through the website and learn a thing or two and stop complaining. I think this is enough. okay bye! 
                </p>
                <h3>How I started and such</h3>
                <p>
                So I have been cooking as a little kid and always enjoyed it from all I can remember. I once <em>allegedly</em> went up to a street vendor, that makes this sort of bread that is popular in Turkey, and told her I can do it better as a 3-year-old. Later on when I was 11-12 I was making desserts and loved doing it. By the time I was 15 I could cook a whole 5 course meal for my family no problem. I like learning about different cultures, foods, and how they invented dishes. I think it is pretty fascinating to see how people, own their own, came up with cooking techniques. My grandma, who hasn't been past elementary school, could tell you how to make yogurt using chickpeas. It is not because she knows about the science behind chickpea water, aquapahaba, and the combination of milk that results in fermentation. People have tried and curated recipes based ontheir experiences or stumbled upon some recipes that are now being studied in a fancy French school with a fancy major name. That is why I enjoy learning about it as everything else cooking is also very white supremacist and revolves around Italian cuisine for some reason and that is why it is only a hobby to me.

                <p>Cooking can be done for necessity for survival. As as humans or any species has to get fuel somehow. For some organisms, plants, sunglight is enough for fuel and that is their food. Humans eat for survival but that is not the only reason we cook. Cooking is done for cultural reasons, religion and every aspect of our lives. Cooking brings people together and gives them a sense of belonging and nostalgia. Cooking can also be a hobby. People cook as a hobby they gather recipes or curate them on  their own. Cooking requires science and quite a bit of chemistry. People research and find ways to cook food properly for the most optimal falvour profile.</p>
                <p>Cooking is a culture and that is why it is also a hobby. Figuring out what people eat and why they do is also anthropology on its own. Cooking is a form of art to many from curating recipes to preparing plates. That is why people cook as a hobby. It is art, history and scinece. These are all hobbies that can be translated as a form of cooking. </p>
