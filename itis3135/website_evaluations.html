        <h3><a href="https://thebiguglywebsite.com">Bad Website</a></h3>
        <ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
            <li>Images do not load, and they seem to be on top of each other</li>
            <li>There is no consistency with alignment, there are random highlights on the text, the website does not seem to be using repetition hence not cohesive.</li>
            <li>There are two columns of text no oragnization to the content makes it hard to read and keep up with.</li>
            <li>There is absolutely no contrst whatsoever, h1 and h2 titles do not seem to be ordered in any way.</li>
            <li>Proximity  is not prioritized as mentioned images are on top of each other while 35% of the webpages is empty on the right side.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3><a href="https://open.spotify.com">Good Website</a></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The page is filled with content navbar on the left side of the page making it easy to navigate</li>
            <li>The pictures are aligned not too close to one another and they are clickable taking you to the album of the cover you click on</li>
            <li>The repetativenes of the outline makes the website cohesive and organized</li>
            <li>The titles are in order there are no subtitles above main titles etc.</li>
            <li>The font and the text is consistent, the login, signup and the main page buttons are clearly seperated from rest of the content making it easy to spot.</li>
        </ul>
