                <h2>Food</h2>
                <p>As mentioned Turkey not only diverse ethnically but these ethnic groups have their own cultures and their foods. The ethnic groups howevere aren't like how we have it in America where it is people all over the world coming together but it is more so generations of tribes, empires coming together and living in a region together. The original turks came from Central Asia and moved to Mesopotomia in the 11th century. Each region of Turkey has its own cusine.</p>
                <p>Th coast of BLack Sea in that region the food is very what we would consider as Eastern European. They have very many fermented dishes as well as variety of fish especially <i>Hamsi</i> a type of fish native to Balck Sea.</p>
                <p>The Mediteranena side has Mediterenena cusine so it is very olive oil, greens and fresh produce heavy</p>
                <p>Anatolian food whch is central Turkey is full of patries and carb heavy</p>
                <p>Southeastern part has avery Middle Eastern Cuisine where many dishes meat.</p>
